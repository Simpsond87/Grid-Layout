## FullPage-Slider
This project is an assignment for theClubhou.se Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp course.

A boilerplate was used for the foundation of the project for ReactJS. The boilerplate included generators for containers and components. It included features such as CSS-loading and Styled-Components. React-Icons, React-Responsive, and Material-UI are also included by default for UI/UX design.
